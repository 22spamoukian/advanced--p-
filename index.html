    <h1>A few things about me</h1>
   	<p>I am 16 years old and attend the Loyola school. I love all things nature and the outdoors.   </p>
    <p> One of my favorite things to do go on hikes in the rain. It does not matter how  <b>DRENCHED</b> I get. I absolutely adore watching sunsets and would spend the rest of my life watching them if I could. I am a competitive boxer and am verty passionate about it. I also love to read a lot, and I try to do it when I get the chance. I also love to travel.<p>
